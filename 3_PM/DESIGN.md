React 'Todo' Application

1. For our React App , we have decided to create two components, one of which contains 
    - a <ul> tqag that contains ...
        - a <div> tag that contains the inputted string , the string id , and a delete button
     - a <div> tag that contains a message regarding "NO TODOS TO COMPLETE" 
            - OR EVEN BETTER use a ternary funtion to display the <div> "NO TODOS TO COMPLETE" in the case that there is no 
     - a <h1> tag that contains a message title "TO-DOs"
     - an <input type="text" > where user can input todos
     - an <input type= "text"> where user can filter through submitted todos 

2. It will be necessary to store the inputted strings into an array of thier components and "push()" new components to the list as we "add" to the list
    - using a type of filter function, with the filter input value to sort through the unordered list an d display no todos to complete if searched todo doesnt exist (filter boolean comination?)
    - MAYBE name id same as todo? so fiter will just compare keys!
    - a delete function that updates the current list without deleted todo
